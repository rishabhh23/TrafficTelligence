Scenario 1: Dynamic Traffic Management
TrafficTelligence enables dynamic traffic management by providing real-time traffic volume estimations. Transportation authorities can use this information to implement adaptive traffic control systems, adjust signal timings, and optimize lane configurations to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.

Scenario 2: Urban Development Planning
City planners and urban developers can leverage TrafficTelligence predictions to plan new infrastructure projects effectively. By understanding future traffic volumes, they can design road networks, public transit systems, and commercial zones that are optimized for traffic efficiency and accessibility.

Scenario 3: Commuter Guidance and Navigation
Individual commuters and navigation apps can benefit from TrafficTelligence's accurate traffic volume estimations. Commuters can plan their routes intelligently, avoiding congested areas and selecting optimal travel times based on predicted traffic conditions. Navigation apps can provide real-time updates and alternative routes to improve overall travel experiences.

Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost and flask.
